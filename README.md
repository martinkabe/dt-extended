# DT Extended

The Shiny application extends the capabilities of current DT tables.

Unlike another DT editable table, users can simply *double-click* to edit the cells they want. Other features include the ability to **insert** and **delete** rows in the table. Keeping changes before closing the browser is allowed by using the **Save** button. Users can also download data in `CSV` or `XLSX` formats.
